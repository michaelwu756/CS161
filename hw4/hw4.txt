The graph coloring problem with graph 1 and 3 colors is unsatisfiable.

The graph coloring problem with graph 1 and 4 colors is satisfiable. The results
of the sat solver indicates that at minimum, 4 colors is necessary to color
graph1. A coloring that can color graph 1 is as follows.

Node 1 gets color 4.
Node 2 gets color 3.
Node 3 gets color 2.
Node 4 gets color 3.
Node 5 gets color 1.
Node 6 gets color 2.
Node 7 gets color 1.

The minimum number of colors required to properly color graph 2 is 8 colors.
